## My process

### Built with
- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to place two images in the same place and hide them with opacity.

For this I have used div instead of image tags

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about flexbox and grid layout. 

Use useful properties like max-width and learn about relative measurements.
